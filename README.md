# Digital-Image-Processing

All labs were done in MATLAB.

Table of Contents:

Lab 1 - Halftoning:
Implemented Halftone of images.

Lab 2 - Interpolation:
Implmented both Nearest Neighbor and Bilinear interpolation. I also implamented RMSE to compute the differences between two images.

Lab 3 - Histogram Equalization:
Implmented a function taht performs histogram equalization on a grayscale image.

Lab 4 - Edge detection and filer:
Implemented a function that detects the edges in a grayscale image and changes values to 255 for edges and 0 for everything else. I also implemented a spacial filter that applies a filter onto a grayscale image. Lastly, I careated a function that computes the magnitude of the gradient of a grayscale image.

Lab 5 - Hough Transformation:
Implemented hough transform that determines the rho and theta values of an edged detected image to create a sinsoidal graph representing which common points were calculated and lines detected within the image
